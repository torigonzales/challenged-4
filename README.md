## Description

Challenge #4- Timed quiz generator 

## Introduction 
This week we were challenged to create a timed quiz. I decided to base my questions on some knowledge I have gained in the coarse so far!  I really enjoyed creating this quiz!

## Challenges

Creating applications from the ground up can be challenging. My biggest challenge was really just remembering the correct order of the syntax. I made sure to use as many resources as possilble!

---

I have done alot extra reaserch in this challenge. I was really challenged to use alot of resources and problem solve. Al little over 30 hours was spent on this challenge, I used alot of new knowledge! Organization has also been one of my top priorities. The idea, is for the code to read like a book. Gotta love formatting! (shift + command + f)

---

I spent several hours trying to get the app to respond with JavaScript. This in itself was very challenging.
